# webui/ – WireBot Web Interface (Planning)

This folder is for the **Web UI** that will run in a browser and talk to the backend on the Raspberry Pi.

The Web UI will:

- Show machine status (IDLE / RUNNING / ERROR)
- Let me configure jobs:
  - Wire length (mm)
  - Quantity (pcs)
  - Feed speed, acceleration
  - Motion/profile mode
- Provide controls:
  - Connect to controllers
  - Home axes
  - Start job / Dry run / Stop
- Display:
  - Number of pieces completed
  - Temperature & fan mode
  - Live log output from backend

For now, there is only planning documentation and placeholders here.
